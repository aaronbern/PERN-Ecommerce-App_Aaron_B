# PERN E-commerce Application

## **Overview:**
This project embodies my exploration into creating a comprehensive e-commerce platform using the PERN stack. The choice to utilize PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js stems from their synergy in delivering scalable, responsive, and user-centric applications.

## **Why PERN?**

- **PostgreSQL:** As a relational database, PostgreSQL offers robust data integrity and complex querying capabilities. This ensures that users receive accurate product listings and their order data remains consistent.
  
- **Express.js & Node.js:** These provide a lightweight, efficient, and scalable backend. The non-blocking nature of Node.js ensures that even with high traffic, users will experience minimal latency.

- **React:** Known for its component-based architecture, React enables dynamic and interactive UIs. This ensures users have an engaging and smooth browsing experience.

## **Features (Planned):**

### User Authentication:
**Why?** Secure authentication protects user data and ensures a personalized shopping experience.
  
### Product Listing with Categories:
**Why?** Organized product listings and categories enhance discoverability and simplify navigation for users, ensuring they find products with ease.

### Shopping Cart and Checkout System:
**Why?** A seamless cart and checkout process reduces friction points, making the buying process more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Admin dashboard for product management:
**Why?** A dedicated admin dashboard ensures timely product updates, promotions, and inventory management, thus keeping users informed of the latest offerings.

## **Development Approach:**
I've chosen to begin with the backend, laying a robust foundation. With clear data models and business logic in place, the frontend will be developed to consume the API endpoints and create an interactive user interface.

## **Development Timeline:**

- [ ] Backend API setup: This will form the backbone of our application, ensuring every functionality has a corresponding endpoint.
  
- [ ] Frontend Store Layout: Creating a visually appealing and intuitive layout to enhance user navigation and experience.
  
- [ ] User Authentication System: Implementing secure login mechanisms to safeguard user data.
